# Controlling VST audio effect plugins from Python 

**Work in Progress.** Not intended for general public, just using GitHub for revision control & cloud storage. 

Not related to any other "pyVST" projects (these appear & disappear).  This is (as it says above) a fork of `dpm` by Igor Gadelha. 

This is a VST host for audio effects -- i.e., audio in and audio out --  as opposted to a "VSTi" host for synths. 

## OS Notes:
* Linux: You can get this to build, but then good luck finding any VST plugins for Linux that *actually work* and/or will build without hassle. 
* Mac: Plenty of plugins available.  But haven't gotten this repo to build yet. ;-) 
* Windows: Haven't bothered to even try yet.
